Good article [here](http://www.adrocknaphobia.com/post.cfm/is-adobe-flex-really-accessible-you-bet-your-robot-voice-it-is), although when using Flex you're also dealing with the framework/component weight to download (which adds about 300k I think), so some users will be waiting before experiencing their accessible Flash. Not sure if the Flash player caches this yet (I remember reading that it was in the pipeline at one stage...)
