I love my MacBook and am very glad I've largely moved over from Windows, but the keyboard freeze on the keyboard when the computer has been idol for a few minutes is very annoying. It doesn't occur when I've an external keyboard plugged into the machine. Hopefully after I get the change to apply [this update](http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/macbookmacbookprokeyboardfirmwareupdate10.html) the built-in keyboard will play nice too.
