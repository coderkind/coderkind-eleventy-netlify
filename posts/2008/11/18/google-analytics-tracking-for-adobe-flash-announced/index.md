As initially spotted on [WebMonkey](http://www.webmonkey.com/blog/Adobe_and_Google_Announce_Flash_Analytics), Google have announced that [Google Analytics is now available for Adobe Flash](http://analytics.blogspot.com/2008/11/want-to-track-adobe-flash-now-you-can.html). Now you can track how long someone has spent in your Flash/Flex app, what they've clicked on, where, etc. [Get the AS3/MXML/component files here](http://code.google.com/p/gaforflash/downloads/list).
