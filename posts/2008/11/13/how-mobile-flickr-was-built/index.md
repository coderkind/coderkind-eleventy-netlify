Really interesting blog post on [how the mobile version of Flickr was constructed](http://code.flickr.com/blog/2008/10/27/lessons-learned-while-building-an-iphone-site/). I haven't had the opportunity to try the mobile version of the site out on a mobile browser aside from iPhone Safari, but it works really well on that browser. You can tell the focus on optimising everything has paid off when it comes down to user experience, and I love the visual feedback that every click provides (so the user isn't left twiddling his/her thumbs wondering if a click has registered).
