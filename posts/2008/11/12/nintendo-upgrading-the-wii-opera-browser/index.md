[Rumor has it](http://kotaku.com/5083712/opera-browser-for-wii-levels-up) that Nintendo are to release an update to the Opera browser on the Wii. Haven't read anything so far as to whether Flash will be upgraded too (it's currently stuck on Flash 7 whereas the PS3 recently had its version of Flash updated to 9). Come on Nintendo; you know it makes sense! Pretty please?
