It seems Apple included a Safari update in their recent 2.1 firmware upgrade and have now opened up a few new things for web developers to play with, as [Matthew Congrove](http://mydailyphoto.com/matthew) [blogs about on myDailyPhoto](http://mydailyphoto.com/blog/iphone-safari-flick-navigation). His iPhone Safari Flick Navigation demo is really impressive and opens up new ways of serving web content to iPhone/iPod Touch users.
