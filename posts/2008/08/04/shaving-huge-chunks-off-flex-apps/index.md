I haven't had the chance to check this out myself, but [darklump.co.uk](http://www.darklump.co.uk) blogs that [excluding font outlines can save 200k off the size of an exported Flex application](http://www.darklump.co.uk/blog/?p=67). Massive saving.

Thanks to [Forever 4th](http://cisnky.com/) for the link.
