iPhone apps continue to evolve. I recently stumbled upon Beatmaker, a music creation tool on sale through the Apple store. It's a bit more expensive than the other apps (around Â£12 I think) and doesn't have midi support yet, but the [demos I've seen](http://youtube.com/watch?v=QiNTC6mSrnU&feature=related) so far have been [extremely impressive](http://www.vimeo.com/1357796?pg=embed&sec=1357796).

Considering there's a solid business model in place for developers with the app store, I can't wait to see what others develop in the coming weeks and months. The iPhone really is a portable computer; not just a smartphone, and I think that'll become increasingly evident as time goes on.
