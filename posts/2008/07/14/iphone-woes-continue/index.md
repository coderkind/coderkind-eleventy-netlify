I decided to call O2 yesterday on the chance that they might be able to give me some information on when my iPhone might be activated. The person at the end of the line said that all phones that weren't activated in-store Friday would definitely be activated by midnight; that they were working through their backlog but everything would be sorted for when I woke up Monday morning.

Monday morning arrived. Guess what? :(

Another call this morning; they're now saying this evening sometime. Fingers crossed, but this isn't a great first impression of a network. I think they've concentrated on selling the devices no matter what; ensured they've made the initial killing and are then worrying about dealing properly with their new customers.

Lame.
