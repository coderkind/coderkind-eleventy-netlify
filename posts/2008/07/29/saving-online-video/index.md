Saw this on the latest edition of [Click](http://www.bbc.co.uk/click) and thought it particularly useful: [splandoo.com](http://www.splandoo.com/) takes a URL from a video page and allows you to save the video. I know there are similar sites but going to give this one a go too to see what the performace is like. With some others I've noticed they can add watermarks to the end of the clip or not work for prolonged periods of time.
