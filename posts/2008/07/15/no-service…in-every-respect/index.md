So, it's Tuesday now and I still don't have any service from my spanking new iPhone 3G. I tried to ring through to O2's helpline last night and was on hold for 20 minutes. I gave up in the end.

A support email has been sent to them to which I got an automated reply. If I don't hear back from them sometime today then I'm marching back into Carphone Warehouse tomorrow morning and ruining someone's morning.

I won't actually march...it'll be more like an angry stroll.
