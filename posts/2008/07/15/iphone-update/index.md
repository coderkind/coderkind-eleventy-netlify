On hold to O2 for 25 minutes...bounced around 4 departments. Finally, it transpires that O2 haven't got my details through from Carphone Warehouse yet, so are doing a manual activation tomorrow. Someone will ring me beforehand to go through what needs to be done before this; providing that goes ok my phone may be working by 1pm tomorrow apparently.

I inquired about compensation. I was told "you're not being charged while there's no service to your phone, but if you want compensation once the handset's enabled then ring back after that time". IF I want compensation?!? IF?!? Why wouldn't I?

It'll be 5 days since purchase and no "phone" part to my iPhone! It's just an "i"!
