Not much else to say; life's been hard recently and it's my birthday soon so I thought I'd treat myself. I've only ever briefly tried an iPod Touch and was impressed, but am dying to try out the revised iPhone.

I've begun reading some tutorials on web development for Safari on the phone. Massive shame that Flash isn't on the device (come on Apple/Adobe, make it happen!). Interesting to see how it integrates with my Macbook.

Roll on friday! :)
