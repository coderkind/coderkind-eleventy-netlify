One of the major pains of web development is having to factor in users with "non-standard configurations". What looks good on your machine doesn't mean it will for a proportion of your users. However, [this no-flash warning up on the South Park website](http://www.southparkstudios.com/layout/skin_v3/img/home/noflash.gif) is pure genius, as is the [404](http://www.southparkstudios.com/layout/skin_v3/img/404/error.jpg). I wish I was given the green light at work to do this!
