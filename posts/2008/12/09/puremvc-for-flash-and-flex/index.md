Following on from a [really good article I read yesterday about not always having the time to factor in OOP and Design Patterns into ActionScript](http://www.as3dp.com/2008/12/07/no-time-for-oop-and-design-patterns/), [Adobe have published an article on PureMVC for Flash and Flex](http://www.adobe.com/newsletters/edge/december2008/articles/article6/index.html?trackingid=EFBLD).

I think it's going to take time for the whole industry to build stuff properly. Flash is so wide-ranging now that you can almost be a specialist in one small part of what the technology allows you to achieve.
