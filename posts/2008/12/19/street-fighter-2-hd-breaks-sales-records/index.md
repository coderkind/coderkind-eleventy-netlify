[Kotaku reveal](http://kotaku.com/5113177/street-fighter-ii-hd-shatters-sales-records) that Capcom have blogged that [the revamped SF2 is on its way to breaking all sales records for a digital download](http://www.capcom-unity.com/johndmoney/blog/2008/12/18/super_street_fighter_ii_turbo_hd_remix_achieves_record_breaking_sales). Still no digital download for PS3 owners in Europe though, which is crazy.

Glad I've got it on 360.
