[SSF2THDR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Street_Fighter_II_Turbo_HD_Remix) is one of the best games I've played this year. I'd forgotten how good the game is, and is a million times more fun playing online. Looking forward to playing (and losing) a competition at work soon! Apparently, the remix (rebalancing) task wasn't easy. Really interesting [interview with Lead designer David Sirlin here](http://www.videogamer.com/features/article/05-12-2008-580.html). Hopefully future projects of a similar nature will be allocated suitable help and finance in future, as the end results with this remixed Street Fighter are clearly worth it.
