Adobe have [posted an article](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/flash_player9_security_update.html) informing those in the Flash community that there's a security update coming next month, and advised developers to subscribe to their [security notification service](http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/entitlement/index.cfm?e=szalert).

Most of it seems to affect socket behaviour, which I unfortuately haven't had much experience with so far (except for pottering around with [SmartFoxServer](http://www.smartfoxserver.com/) at home and multiplayer tile-based game mockups), but looks like some older swfs (Flash 7 and below) played out in the new player may experience issues.
