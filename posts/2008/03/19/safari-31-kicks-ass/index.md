Apple have [updated Safari](http://blog.wired.com/monkeybites/2008/03/safari-update-c.html) to version 3.1 to include support for a lot of [cutting-edge technology](http://ajaxian.com/archives/safari-31-released) (including [client-side database storage](http://webkit.org/blog/126/webkit-does-html5-client-side-database-storage/)), along with adding a native developer dropdown (enabled within the preferences section). With Firefox 3, Opera 9.5 [coming soon](http://crave.cnet.co.uk/software/0,39029471,49296021,00.htm) and, erm, IE8, it's looking like the browser market is about to make web developer's lives a lot more interesting soon.

By "interesting" I of course mean more difficult!

P.S. Visit [this page](http://webkit.org/blog/138/css-animation/) in Safari 3.1 to see some funky CSS animation. Coo!
