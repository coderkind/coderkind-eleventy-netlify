Damn spam; fed up with dealing with hundreds of spam submissions whenever I attempt to moderate comments on the blog. Going to look into plug-ins which help with this, but for the time being I'm turning off the ability to comment of posts.

EDIT: turns out I deactivated the spam filter when I last tried upgrading Wordpress. Dur! Thanks to [Anthony](http://cisnky.com/) for pointing that out! :)
