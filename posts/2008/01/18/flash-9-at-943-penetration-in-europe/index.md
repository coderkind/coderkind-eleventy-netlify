Emmy Huang's blog [reveals](http://weblogs.macromedia.com/emmy/archives/2008/01/flash_player_9_11.cfm) the new stats for Flash penetration across the world for December 2007 (also up on Adobe's [site](http://www.adobe.com/products/player_census/flashplayer/version_penetration.html)). While the US figures are an even more impressive 95.3%, in Europe having 94.3% of users able to view Flash 9 content is amazing.

Worth taking with a tiny pinch of salt, as our internal stats often shave about 5-8% off usually, but still really really good.
