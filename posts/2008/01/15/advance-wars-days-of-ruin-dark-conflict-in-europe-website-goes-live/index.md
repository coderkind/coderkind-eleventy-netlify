The Flash-based site for the new Nintendo DS [Advance Wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Wars:_Days_of_Ruin) game [has gone live](http://www.advancewars.com/). I really like the style of the site and while there isn't that much content up there yet it offers a taste of the game to come.

The previous games in the series have all been brilliant, so really looking forward to this one (which'll offer online play for the first time too).

Roll-on the [25th Jan...](http://www.play.com/Games/DS/4-/3594196/Advance-Wars-Dark-Conflict/Product.html)
