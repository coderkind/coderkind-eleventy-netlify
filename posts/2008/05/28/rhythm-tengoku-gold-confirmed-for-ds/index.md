Rhythm Tengoku is one of the best games on the Gameboy Advance (and [Gameboy Micro](http://www.flickr.com/photos/coderkind/343213866/)!) and a game you can almost play with your eyes closed. Now it's coming to the DS and I couldn't be happier! Blog posting on [Kotaku](http://kotaku.com/5011289/new-rhythm-heaven-new-wario-games-incoming-yes-soon-%5Bupdate%5D), with screenshots [here](http://www.nintendo.co.jp/n08/brij/topics/index.html#topics04). It looks like a revamp/enhanced version of the GBA game. I hope they release it in the west (or at least an English language option in the Japanese version).
