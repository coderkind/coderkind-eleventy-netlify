A good post from Aral regarding [the state of accessibility within Flex](http://aralbalkan.com/1334). I hope they concentrate on this side of Flash soon rather than adding more wizzy features; it seems with Flash and AJAX you're always having to hold your hands up and admit that they don't bring a lot to the party when it comes to people with specific accessibility issues.
