I'm not sure if the old saying "shit always comes in threes" really is true, but this weekend both my [black Macbook](http://www.flickr.com/photos/coderkind/2835159752/) and my [main television](http://www.flickr.com/photos/coderkind/2836915110/) have both broken.

The Mac looks to be a hard drive failure, which is a big deal.

I fully expect my head to fall off sometime within the next few days. Or one of my ears at the very least.
