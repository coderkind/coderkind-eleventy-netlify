Don't think much of Adobe's solution to this [invisible link hack for Flash](http://www.webmonkey.com/blog/Hackers_are_Watching_You%3A_Flash_Clickjacking_Vulnerability_Exposes_Webcams_and_Mics) which enables the bad people to gain access to your webcam/microphone, but I'm not sure what else they can do seeing as the hack involves things outside of the Flash player (CSS opacity, etc).
