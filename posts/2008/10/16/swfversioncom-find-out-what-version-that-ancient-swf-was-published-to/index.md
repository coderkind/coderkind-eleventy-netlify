The number of times I've experienced producers or website editors asking questions about .swf's published years ago (for which the .fla is often lost) is crazy. [Flashmagazine.com](http://www.flashmagazine.com) [published an article yesterday](http://www.flashmagazine.com/news/detail/swfversioncom/) outlining a new service that's launched as a beta; [swfversion.com](http://www.swfversion.com). Using new Flash 10 magic (not the technical term, but you get my drift), it enables anyone with that version of the plug-in to check what version of ActionScript and what player version the .swf was published for. Incredibly useful in dealing with legacy content.
