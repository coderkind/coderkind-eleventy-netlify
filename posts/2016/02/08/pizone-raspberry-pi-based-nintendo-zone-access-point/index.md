Nice project from [Mike Chambers](http://www.mikechambers.com/blog/); [pizone creates a customer Nintendo Zone access point](http://www.mikechambers.com/blog/2016/02/01/pizone---raspberry-pi-based-nintendo-zone-access-point/), allowing you to get Spot and Street Passes from people around the world. You're usually restricted to those you come within close physical contact with (along with your 3DS hardware of course).

Time to acquire some more Mii hats and outfits :)
