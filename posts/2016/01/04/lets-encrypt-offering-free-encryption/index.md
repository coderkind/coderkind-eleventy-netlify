Encryption is increasingly an important and relevant topic when it comes to web development (security, ServiceWorker-powered offline pages, etc), but the costs involved make it prohibitive to devs wanting to dip their toes in the subject. [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/howitworks/) looks to offer a free service which should be a big help to everyone in making the web more secure but also more available when stuck in a tunnel somewhere without wifi.

Tim Kadlec discusses it in his "[Taking Let's Encrypt for a Spin](https://timkadlec.com/2015/12/taking-lets-encrypt-for-a-spin/)" article.
