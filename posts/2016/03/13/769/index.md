Fantastic post on Reddit on [the confusion behind 480p content onÂ CRTs](https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/1u0yno/so_im_confused_480p_lessthan30_nonhd_crts_dont/). Still trying to get my head around some aspects of this whole discussion (having recently acquired a BVM); the first thing that's hitting me is how crucial (and expensive) the correct cables and leads are.
