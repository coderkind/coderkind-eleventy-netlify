[This link](http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/860/cpsid_86018.html) is very useful in working out the changes in Android Flash Player, although a proper change log somewhere would be nice Adobe. Also, I think because I was using the default version of Flash that came with Android it didn't offer to auto-update or indicate if/when a new version of Flash Player was available (whereas it now offers me that option now that I've searched and downloaded the latest version).

How is the average Joe supposed to realise he/she hasn't the latest version of the plug-in installed?!? This is important, especially given the fixes that have apparently been made in the recent 10.1 minor releases.
