Will expand upon this at a later date, but been trying to get documentation working with another person's code via ASDoc and failing. Turns out something like this works so far in the arguments field:

- \-lenient
- \-source-path src
- \-doc-sources src
- \-exclude-sources src/com
- \-exclude-sources src/fl
- \-output DOCS
