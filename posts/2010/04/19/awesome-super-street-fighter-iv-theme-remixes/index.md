Wow. I've been reading-up on the new Street Fighter religiously but up until now I haven't heard any mention of the remixed music. [EventHubs have just posted links to remixed theme tunes](http://www.eventhubs.com/news/2010/apr/19/new-character-themes-super-street-fighter-4) and they're bloody excellent.

Favourite at the moment has to be [Dudley's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_Ox7ifjz70), which reaches new levels of cheese for 90's dance music.
