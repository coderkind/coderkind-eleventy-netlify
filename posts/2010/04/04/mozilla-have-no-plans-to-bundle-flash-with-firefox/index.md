Adobe Flash received a very welcome shot in the arm recently when Google announced that it was to package Flash with its Chrome browser. Mozilla however have since [announced that they have no plans to follow suit](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/04/02/mozilla_no_flash_plans/).

Flash usually runs comparatively poorly in Firefox, so it's a shame it's not receiving any love to improve its performance.
