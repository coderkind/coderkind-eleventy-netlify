[Mega Man 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Man_2) was/is one of my favorite games of all time. The gameplay, graphics, music...oh, the music! So it turns out that a lot of the music might've been possibly [inspired from elsewhere](http://kotaku.com/5613391/a-few-notes-of-elton-john-in-mega-man-2s-soundtrack) allegedly. Doesn't matter to me one bit however; the game's still near absolute perfect.

Worth checking out the comments on the [Kotaku](http://kotaku.com/) post for further examples...
