[This posting on Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/5547037/change-the-user-agent-on-an-android-phone) is very useful if Android's tendancy towards bouncing you over to mobile versions of sites is annoying you. However, I noticed you can also play around with the Flash plug-in settings using this method too; switching between Flash 10 and Flash Lite (on Froyo anyway).
