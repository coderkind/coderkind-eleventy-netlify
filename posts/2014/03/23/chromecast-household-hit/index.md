Ok; I was skeptical about the [Google Chromecast](http://www.google.co.uk/intl/en_uk/chrome/devices/chromecast/). When it was released in the states I didn't immediately bite (despite it being cheap enough to import). I'm mainly an iOS user (and fan) and so I wasn't sure I'd get enough use out of a wifi HDMI dongle that presumably might see most support on Android.

But I was kinda wrong.

The device doesn't really do anything I couldn't already achieve through other means, be it wired connections or whatever. But there's a certain cool factor to being able to control what's on your television with your smart device and my kids have seemingly bought into it big time. I found it hard to wrestle my iPhone away from my youngest today once she got used to loading up various childrens content from [BBC iPlayer](http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/) and when she did give me my phone back it was to swap for the [Google Nexus 7](http://www.google.co.uk/nexus/7/) that offered the same functionality of controlling her content from the sofa.

My eldest also found it very cool and it prompted her to download a few apps to her [Moto G](http://www.motorola.co.uk/consumers/mobile-phones/Moto-G/moto-g-gb.html) to take proper advantage of the device.

As for me? I tried casting some sports from Google Chrome via the [BT Sport](http://sport.bt.com/) website last night (after installing the [Google Cast extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-cast/boadgeojelhgndaghljhdicfkmllpafd?hl=en)) but found the sound cut out from the transmission. Maybe it's a [Microsoft Silverlight](http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/) issue as I found various [Adobe Flash](http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/) content streamed just fine ([BBC News](http://m.bbc.co.uk/news/video_and_audio), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/), etc). I read that when casting from the Chrome browser to use the lower bitrate 720p setting but I found the highest 720p setting worked just fine; there was no difference between the slightly jerky frame rate I was viewing on the television (but obviously the picture quality looked a little better).

Overall, I think the device is worth buying and I really hope developers adopt it wholeheartedly. I'm very tempted to go do some tinkering with it myself... :)
