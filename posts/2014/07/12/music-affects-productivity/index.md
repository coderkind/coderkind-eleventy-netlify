I had already come to many of the same conclusions after working in a busy, open office for years but this article sums up a lot about [how useful listening to music can be regarding productivity](http://www.sparringmind.com/music-productivity/).

I bought the [Denon AH-D600 headphones](http://www.pocket-lint.com/review/73082-denon-ah-600-headphones-review) a year or so back and they remain one of the best investments I've made as not only does music sound great (particularly base-driven content), but they double-up as an effective headset when I need to Skype colleagues to discuss work-related tasks.
