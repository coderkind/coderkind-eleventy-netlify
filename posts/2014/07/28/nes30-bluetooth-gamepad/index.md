I'm a sucker for most things NES-related as it's the first games console I ever owned. I enjoy touchscreen gaming to an extent although it remains heavily dependent on the type of game and how effectively the developers have implemented the controls.

I might not have to worry about all that much longer... as I've ordered an NES30 bluetooth gamepad! There's a pretty comprehensive [review of the NES30 over atÂ gameusagi.com](http://gameusagi.com/2014/07/nes30-bluetooth-gamepad/). It looks great and if it enables me to play games on my iPad, Android Nexus 7 and the 5.5 inch iPhone 6 later on this year (!) then it'll be well worth the investment.

Once it arrives I'll do a review.
