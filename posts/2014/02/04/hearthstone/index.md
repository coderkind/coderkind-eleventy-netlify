So, after hearing a lot of people rave about [Hearthstone](http://eu.battle.net/hearthstone/en/) recently I decided to give the game a go. I kinda like it!

It's been described as a perfect lunchtime-type of game; even though I'm not sure I'd get favourable looks playing this in the middle of the office (even on lunch break), it is a very good "quick 10min" type of game.

Given time is at a premium more than ever these days, these are the type of games I see myself playing for the foreseeable future.

If you want to add me to your friends list, I'm "coderkind" on Hearthstone :)
