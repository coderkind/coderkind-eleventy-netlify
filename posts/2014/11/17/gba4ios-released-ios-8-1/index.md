As read on [Pocket Gamer, GBA4iOS has been released for iOS 8.1](http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/iPhone/Emulation/news.asp?c=62578). Having tried the previous version on iOS 8 on iPhone 6 Plus, I can recommend the emulator. It's great that you can download and compile the [source code for GBA4iOS](https://bitbucket.org/rileytestut/gba4ios/) too!
