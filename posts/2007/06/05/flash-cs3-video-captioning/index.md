Flash needs all the accessibility points it can get, so articles such as [this](http://www.digital-web.com/articles/captions_flash_video/) are welcome in enlightening both developers and consumers regarding Flash video's current assessibility status.

Hopefully we'll see big websites including these features, as otherwise the masses won't be aware of the accessibility efforts Adobe are making.

In related news, I'm attending Adobe Live! today and tomorrow. Apollo (through which the upcoming [Adobe Media Player](http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Media_Player) will run) seemingly will have incomplete accessibility included in the version 1.0 release. This will apparently be improved in subsequent releases.

Shame accessibility isn't high-enough up the list of requirements to be fully there come the full release around the end of the year.
