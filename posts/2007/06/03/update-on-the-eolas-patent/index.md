It looks like [Microsoft are returning](http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/114564/microsoft-to-challenge-eolas-patent.html) to challenge the Eolas patent that cost the Redmond giant so much money and trouble in the past.

It's probably too late to expect a change to the way embedded content is dealt with in Internet Explorer these days (effectively relying on embedding with JavaScript), but as someone dealing with embedded content on a regular basis (Adobe Flash, etc), I hated the original ruling for Eolas.

Interesting thing in the artlicle linked is that US patents are not valid internationally; I think a lot of the time people in countries other than the US (i.e. here in the UK) read "the internet news" from the states and assume it applies in their own countries.
