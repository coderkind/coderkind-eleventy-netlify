It seems Adobe have relented and included DRM within Flash video with the announcement of [Adobe Media Player](http://news.com.com/Adobe+to+take+Flash+videos+to+desktop/2100-1012_3-6176056.html?tag=nefd.top).

Hot on their heels is Microsoft, who've also announced [Silverlight](http://news.com.com/Microsoft+sheds+light+on+Flash+rival/2100-1012_3-6176022.html?tag=nefd.lede), a plug-in for Windows and Mac that'll work across the major browsers too.

Who will win? Hopefully Flash, but it'll depend on which of the big boys incorporate what technology on their sites, despite the apparent [lacking in Silverlight's feature set compared to Flash](http://www.onflex.org/ted/2007/04/m-silverlight-vs-adobe-flash-player.php). I'd also like to think the ease of development might also help drive either technology.
