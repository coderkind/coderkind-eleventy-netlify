Final version of the Wii browser has been released. You need to perform a small system update before upgrading apparently. Still stuck with Flash 7 because Adobe haven't updated their SDK (which would also explain why the Playstation 3's implementation of Flash is also stuck at 7).

Still, looking forward to downloading and giving it a try later! Any technical questions can also be searched for on Opera's Wii forum.
