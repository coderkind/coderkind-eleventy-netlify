Two competing standards currently going at it to become the future markup language of the web, XHTML2 and HTML5. Mozilla, Opera and Apple are siding with HTML5, but there are also arguments from the other perspective, that XHTML2 is preferable to HTML5.

I'm unfortunately betting on whichever Microsoft decide to go with.
