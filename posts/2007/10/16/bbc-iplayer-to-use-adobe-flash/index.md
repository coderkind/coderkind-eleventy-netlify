It's about time. Adobe [have announced](http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200710/101507adobebbc.html) that the BBC iPlayer is to use Adobe Flash in order to deliver content to Mac and Linux users.

I've used the PC version of iPlayer, and while it worked well the number of updates and applications you need to install as a result of the DRM measures adopted is really excessive. I thought so and I'm a techy, so goodness knows what Joe Public thinks.

Be good to see how the Flash version holds up.
