If you've worked with Flash and Internet Explorer within the past few years, [this](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2007/11/08/ie-automatic-component-activation-changes-to-ie-activex-update.aspx) will be a godsend. It should have accessibility benefits too, as sites which aren't embedding Flash via JavaScript won't have to click into content anymore.

Stupid ruling in the first place. Another example of money coming before the best interests of the internet and its users.
