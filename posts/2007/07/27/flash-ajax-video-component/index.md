Intend to look a lot closer at [this](http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Flash-Ajax_Video_Component) new development from Adobe, which allows you to stick video on a webpage via a JavaScript embed specifying a few parameters. Looks very promising; works by bringing different skin swfs.

More on FAVideo can be found on [gskinner's blog](http://www.gskinner.com/blog/archives/2007/07/favideo_release.html). Didn't realise Grant Skinner had been involved in the creation of this application.
