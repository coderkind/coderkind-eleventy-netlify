Unfortunately, due to the different virtual machines that process ActionScript when dealing with AS1/2 or AS3, it's not straightforward to communicate between content developed in the latest version of Flash/Flex and older content.

Thankfully, a few people have come to the rescue in the form of SWFBridge and ActionScriptBridge. I'm sure either is likely to come in handy.
