Over at OSFlash they've released a tool which aids in the detection of a screen reader (before throwing them tons of AJAX or incompatible Flash). After a quick squint at the code it seems they've accounted for Flash not returning correct values for screen reader presence until a few seconds have elapsed, so it looks like good stuff.

Check it out [here](http://osflash.org/flashaid).
