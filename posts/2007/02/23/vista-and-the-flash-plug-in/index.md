It sounds like Flash may not work 100% as expected in Windows Vista unless a user's using the latest version of the plug-in (9,0,28):

It seemingly relates to a subset of specific functions which conflict with Vista's security model:

- Shared objects (Flash cookies)
- Local Connection (Flash movies talking to each other)
- File reference (saving and opening files within Flash)
- Express Install (auto-updating a user's version of the plug-in)

I haven't a copy of Vista to check any of this unfortunately, although I've no reason to doubt it. It sounds like something that might only affect users upgrading from XP and retaining older versions of the plug-in, or developers, developers, developers...
