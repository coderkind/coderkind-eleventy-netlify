While the Opera browser on the Nintendo Wii's still in Beta, [this](http://www.wiiminder.com/) looks like providing a few additional widgets to make surfing a better experience.

In case Nintendo are reading this (as if!); please, please, please enable as much Flash/JavaScript as possible in the final version of the browser. It makes sense if your games release schedule is as slow as it is currently, as you'll get a lot of homebrew games and activities developed by the masses that'll tide people over in the meantime.

Being able to capture the full range of wiimote movement and button presses in Flash would lead to some amazing content being developed, and it wouldn't matter that the PS3 browser features Flash 7 too if you open up the API. Then the developer community wouldn't have to resort to workarounds like [Mario's great efforts](http://www.quasimondo.com/archives/000638.php).
