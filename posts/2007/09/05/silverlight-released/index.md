So, [Silverlight](http://silverlight.net/) finally gets a release. The [Halo 3](http://halo3.msn.com/videosHD.aspx) demo is nice enough, but I haven't seen anything that knocks my socks off as a developer yet. My money's still on Flash; ["Moviestar"](http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashplayer9/) adds H.264 video support (HD) and going by Ted Patrick's blog post it seems the next version of the Flash player, "Astro", is going to add even more features.

I still think Adobe need to add DRM support for video when not served from an Adobe Media Server; it pretty much renders progressively-downloaded video with any rights issues unusable otherwise.
