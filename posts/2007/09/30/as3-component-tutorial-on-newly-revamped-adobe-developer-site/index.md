Adobe have revamped their [developer site](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/), judging by the post on [Robert Penner's site](http://robertpenner.com/flashblog/2007/09/creating-as3-components-in-flash-lost.html). The ActionScript 3 [component tutorial](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flash/articles/creating_as3_components.html) looks invaluable to those wanting to create components in the new language.
