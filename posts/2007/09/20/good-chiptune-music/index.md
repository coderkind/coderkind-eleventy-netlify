There's a good selection of chiptune music up on the [16 dimensional records](http://www.yarhalla.jpn.org/yarhalla/16d/index_e.html) website. I'd heard the [Gerbera](http://yaruhara.moe-nifty.com/16d/16d002-02-dong-gerbera.mp3) track before by Dong and liked it a lot and the new album, 9801st marriage proposal, is really good.

Especially recommend [hanatachibana](http://yaruhara.moe-nifty.com/16d/16d004-04-dong-hanatachibana.mp3), top track.
