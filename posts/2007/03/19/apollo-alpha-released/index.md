Adobe have released an alpha of Apollo (available [here](http://labs.adobe.com/)).

Their [demo](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/videos/apollo_demo07/index.html) is worth watching if you've a spare 5 minutes; looks like it could target the range of web APIs out there to create some nice custom desktop applications. Mike Downey talks about the product [here](http://corporatemedianews.digitalmedianet.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=115305). Lynda.com have released nearly an hour's worth of free tutorials [here](http://movielibrary.lynda.com/html/modPage.asp?ID=378).

What'sÂ interesting about the first video link above is that there's a transcript provided underneath the video; haven't seen Adobe do that for video content before. Perhaps the start of a trend towards more accessible Flash video?
