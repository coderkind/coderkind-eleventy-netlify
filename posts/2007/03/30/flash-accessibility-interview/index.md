[This interview](http://www.wait-till-i.com/index.php?p=374) with Niqui Merret and Aral Balkan makes good reading for those trying to work out the general situation regarding Flash and accessibility.

I'll be keeping an eye on Niqui's site in future too, as it looks like being a good resource for anyone looking at accessibility in general.
