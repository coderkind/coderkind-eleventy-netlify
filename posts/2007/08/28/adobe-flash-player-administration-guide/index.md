When I get the chance I plan on picking [this article](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/flash_player_admin_guide.html) about Flash 8 and 9 installations apart, as Flash can seemingly do strange things depending on how it's installed (judging by past experience at work).

Straight link to the PDF here.
