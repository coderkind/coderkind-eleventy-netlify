Beta player here, with the FAQ here. Still no word on DRM and/or protecting content in the plug-in (as opposed to outside the browser through Adobe Media Player). Shame; looks like Silverlight will still have it trumped in that respect, as not everyone's going to want to shell out for Adobe's media server to ensure secure streaming of content.
