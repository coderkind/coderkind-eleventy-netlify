It sounds like the API has changed enough to warrant revised examples on sites kind enough to provide them, such as on [Kevin Hoyt's site](http://blog.kevinhoyt.org/2007/12/18/samples-updated-for-air-beta-3/).

The new beta can be downloaded from Adobe labs [here](http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/air.html), with updates for the [Flash AE](http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/AIR:Flash_CS3_Professional_Update) and [DreamWeaver](http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/AIR:Dreamweaver_CS3_Extension) also available.
