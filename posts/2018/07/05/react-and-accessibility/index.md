I've been looking into React recently, and searching out resources related to accessibility with the tech. So far [https://simplyaccessible.com/article/react-a11y/](https://simplyaccessible.com/article/react-a11y/) is a good read, along with [https://blog.usejournal.com/getting-started-with-web-accessibility-in-react-9e591fdb0d52](https://blog.usejournal.com/getting-started-with-web-accessibility-in-react-9e591fdb0d52). React's own docs also here: [https://reactjs.org/docs/accessibility.html](https://reactjs.org/docs/accessibility.html).
