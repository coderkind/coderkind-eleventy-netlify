I love stuff like this :)

Chris Beaumont has [hacked the NES version of Wheel of Fortune](https://chrisbeaumont.org/infinite_wheel/) for the Nintendo Entertainment System to replace the out-of-date questions with a more modern batch.

People have of course done this before for other titles on different platforms (updating teams in Pro Evolution Soccer 6 on the PS2, etc), and it makes so much sense if the game engine still holds up.

If it ain't broke, don't fix it (or rather... just update it).
