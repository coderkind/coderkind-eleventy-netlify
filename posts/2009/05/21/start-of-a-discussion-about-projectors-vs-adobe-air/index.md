There looks like there could be the beginning of an interesting debate on projectors vs. AIR apps at the bottom of [this post](http://www.flashmagazine.com/news/detail/mprojector_4_released/) on [FlashMagazine.com](http://www.flashmagazine.com). Are projectors largely redundant now as a result of technologies like AIR? I don't think so myself, although there doesn't really seem to be a single dominant technology for desktop apps as yet.
