...depending on how you read the [stats](http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2009/12/22/firefox-35-most-popular-browser/) (i.e. it measures individual browser versions). Still; it's reason to remain optimistic that IE6 might soon be a browser we no longer have to code for (unless you live in Africa...or Asia).
