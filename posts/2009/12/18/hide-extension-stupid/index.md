I thought it was only Windows which offered to hide file extensions, but I've just tried to download a JavaScript file off the net via Safari 4.0.4 and it hides the extension by default seemingly. I hate that; why would anyone ever want to be in the dark over what type of file they're working with?

Grrrr >:(
