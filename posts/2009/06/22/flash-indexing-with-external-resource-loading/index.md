Google have expanded their Flash indexing capabilities by [allowing for the indexing of external assets](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2009/06/flash-indexing-with-external-resource.html). A lot of Flash applications read in some sort of XML config file, which in turn often loads in additional assets such as images, mp3s, etc. This is a big deal in getting Flash properly indexable, so kudos to Google.
