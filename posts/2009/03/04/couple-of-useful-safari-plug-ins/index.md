[XML View Plugin](http://www.entropy.ch/blog/Mac+OS+X/2009/02/09/Safari-Plugin-for-Viewing-XML-Data.html) allows you to view XML within Safari in a useful way (and not have to "view > source" to properly read the XML).

[ClickToFlash](http://github.com/rentzsch/clicktoflash/tree/master) prevents automatic loading of Flash content.

I think I'm sticking to Firefox on the Mac for the time being however ;)
