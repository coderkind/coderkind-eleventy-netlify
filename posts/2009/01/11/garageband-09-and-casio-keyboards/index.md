We've an underused [Casio LK-93TV](http://ftp.casio.co.jp/pub/world_manual/emi/en/lk_93tv/lk_93tv_e.pdf) at home and the announcement of [GarageBand '09](http://www.apple.com/uk/ilife/garageband/) (as part of [iLife '09](http://www.apple.com/uk/ilife/)) got me pretty interested as there seems to be music tutorial features in the package. Connecting the Casio keyboard to GarageBand '08 didn't seem to work however, which then prompted me to do a search and I found out Casio don't make Mac drivers for their keyboards (supposedly).

I then found a link to a [MIDI driver here which enabled GarageBand '08 to recognised the USB-connected Casio](http://code.google.com/p/casiousbmididriver/) and now everything's working fine. Thanks a lot to [ferland francois](http://code.google.com/u/ferland.francois/) for taking the trouble of coding a solution!
