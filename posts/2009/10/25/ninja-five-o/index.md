I've neglected to write any blog posts for a while as I've been busy feeding my brain, but during my travels recently I've been playing and replaying [Ninja Five-O](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja_Five-O) on my [Gameboy Micro](http://www.flickr.com/photos/coderkind/343213866/). This game (released as "Ninja Cop" in England) is in my opinion the best ever side-scrolling ninja game ever, and from reading user opinions on the web it seems that 99% of the people who play it [agree](http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/gba/ninjafiveo).

It's a big shame these days that marketing budgets and geared towards gaming sequels and mainstream "sure-thing" titles, as with a little more recognition games like Ninja Five-O could've sold well enough to lead Konami to make a sequel. As it stands however, if you've the opportunity I'd highly recommend playing the game.
