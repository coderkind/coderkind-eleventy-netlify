Good to hear that Flash support isn't standing still on the Nintendo Wii. As [this blog post](http://flashmobile.scottjanousek.com/2009/09/01/nintendo-wii-flash-player-supported-via-opera-updated-to-flash-lite-3-1-flash-89/) says, we need it on the Nintendo DSi now (providing it can run at a decent speed...erm, which might not be that likely actually, so maybe not).
