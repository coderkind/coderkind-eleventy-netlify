Hacking IKEA? I didn't realise that was even a \*thing\*, but over on the [IKEA hackers site](http://www.ikeahackers.net/) they've shown off a [MICKE](http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/products/20244747/#/30296024) [computer desk arcade stick hack](http://www.ikeahackers.net/2015/04/micke-computer-desk-arcade-stick-hack.html) that's pretty awesome. There's a [video of the computer desk arcade stick hack on YouTube here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i50ZvHOPGU).

Awesome. Did I already say that?

I love the handles/stick shaft implementation. It's using [Phreakmods' The Link](http://www.phreakmods.com/products/the-link), which I've got on one of my arcade sticks at home and would recommend as a portable solution (although some of the rigidity of a standard JLF shaft is lost when you install it).
