Found a couple of very useful links on YouTube for getting the best quality video onto their site. The first is a [general video encoding guideline](http://support.google.com/youtube/bin/static.py?hl=en&topic=1728588&guide=1728585&page=guide.cs) which gives sizes, bitrates and resolution information. The second offers [advanced encoding specs](http://support.google.com/youtube/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1297408) (particularly to do with QuickTime).
