The quest to solve high resolution image sourcing continues. Not sure if what [Safari and Chrome are proposing](http://www.webmonkey.com/2012/08/safari-chrome-now-support-high-resolution-images-in-css/) also covers images referenced in the HTML itself however.

EDIT: reading the [Cloud Four Blog article](http://blog.cloudfour.com/safari-6-and-chrome-21-add-image-set-to-support-retina-images/) reveals there's no solution for IMG tags in place unfortunately.
