After years of Flash dragging its heals in the way of offering gamepad support, I'm very excited that Google Chrome (and soon Firefox) offers gamepad support via the Gamepad API. There's a good breakdown on things in "[Jumping the hurdles with the Gamepad API](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/doodles/gamepad/)". Looking forward to trying this out at home (where I have access to a joypad...or 37).
