Interesting to hear that [Street Fighter x Tekken hasn't hit the sales targets Capcom were expecting](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-05-15-capcom-sales-of-street-fighter-x-tekken-have-fallen-short-of-our-plan). Can't say I'm surprised as I'm firmly in the "disappointed" camp after buying the Special Edition version of the game (and this is from someone who absolutely loves the various flavours of Street Fighter IV).

Great discussion in the comments that are well worth reading. Trying to get something down on computer about the whole topic but brain too full right now (for a change).
