Interesting article on Eurogamer on [Half-Byte Loader on the PlayStation Vita](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-05-08-half-byte-loader-the-psp-homebrew-tool-thats-hacking-vita). I've messed about with the PlayStation Suite SDK and it seems really accessible and fun to use, so it's a shame to read about the restrictions on it towards the bottom of the article (no open source, signing contracts, etc). If the SDK terms were friendly enough towards developers I'm sure a whole range of interesting and wonderful apps would spring up for the device.

Still intregued by the Vita (even though I can't afford one). Sony...if you're listening... \*cough\*
