I finally got around to doing something I'd wanted to try for a long time; to mod a joystick. I think the last time I'd touched naked electronics was back when I was 14 or 15 at school (quite a long time ago now), so the project was quite exciting (and a little bit scary). Thankfully it all went really well; I found the experience rewarding and the end result I'm very happy with. I took a [series of photos outlining each of the steps](http://www.flickr.com/photos/coderkind/sets/72157629260160929/), so if interested please check them out.
