I followed [my glass eye's iCade Sanwa mod guide](http://www.myglasseye.net/news/2012/01/how-to-customise-your-icade-stick-and-buttons/) and modded my [iCade](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICade). The experience was almost seemless; finding a high street store that knew what a dremel was was a challenge however. I inquired at Halfords at one point and after explaining to the staff member that I wanted it to "modify a joystick" he helpfully replied "well, we stock car parts, we're not a joystick parts store". Thanks; my bad... I should've gone to my local arcade parts store next to McDonalds. You can find them almost everywhere!

The [dremel tool I bought from Halfords](http://www.halfords.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/product_storeId_10001_catalogId_10151_productId_157303_langId_-1_categoryId_165557) kinda did the job in widening the holes for the buttons and the joystick (use goggles and a mask as bits of plastic get everywhere). I think the mod might've broken it though as the sanding tool I used subsequently doesn't screw properly at the top. I could've used sandpaper I guess but didn't fancy spending hours on it and I also hadn't used a dremel before. I also bought a "[terminal connector block](http://www.halfords.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/product_storeId_10001_catalogId_10151_productId_216975_langId_-1_categoryId_265878)" from Halfords after initially buying a "[terminal block strip](http://www.wickes.co.uk/5a-terminal-block-strip/invt/710110/)" from Wickes. I have little-to-no electrical experience (and neither did the guy I asked in Wickes seemingly) but it turned out that both would probably be equivalent to the "screw terminal" mentioned in my glass eye's tutorial.

I ordered all joystick parts from [Gremlin Solutions](http://www.gremlinsolutions.co.uk/) but was almost caught out by the Sanwa stick not including any of the small hexagonal screws that enable the joystick to be screwed to the iCade's body. I had to disassemble the stock joystick that came with the iCade to retrieve those screws; if I hadn't then the joystick wouldn't have been securely attached to the iCade's body and the mod would've failed.

The only other slightly tricky element were the two [Torx security screws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torx) (pin-in-hex-socket) that came on my iCade (some iCade's seemingly don't feature these); this required a special trip to Maplin to buy the cheapest screwdriver set I could find with the correct head to unscrew the security screws.

In summary; a mod that was slightly trickier than the [previous mod](http://www.coderkind.com/2012/02/12/wwe-brawlstick-mod/) I'd attempted but I'm very happy with the end result which looks and plays amazing I feel.
