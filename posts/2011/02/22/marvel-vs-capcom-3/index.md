The game is finally out and I have to say I'm enjoying it. Not enjoying it as much as Super Street Fighter IV, as it's not as good a game (in pretty much all respects), but it's still good to see another good fighting game released onto the market.

For those who might be getting to grips with Marvel vs Capcom 3 for the first time, a good video tutorial can be found [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bH2d-7APrWo).
