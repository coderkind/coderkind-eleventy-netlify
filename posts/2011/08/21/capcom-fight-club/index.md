Attended the first [Capcom Fight Club](http://www.capcom-europe.com/blog/2011/08/dont-forget-fight-club-uk-this-saturday/) and enjoyed it. Reminded me of the arcade scene around the late 90s; lots of people gathered in the same room(s) just enjoying games. Vibe to the event was good, although it was way over-subscribed and queue-jumpers really took the piss out of anyone else who'd queued for hours (like I did). [The queue](http://www.flickr.com/photos/coderkind/6063839228/in/set-72157627479571964) was single or double-file around 6pm, but by 7pm it was easily 5-file in width throughout. Wish Capcom did pre-registration like they did when they threw their Marvel vs Capcom 3 session before Christmas in London last year.

Still, the event was enjoyable. [Street Fighter x Tekken](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Fighter_X_Tekken) looks really good (didn't get a chance to play unfortunately), and I'll be getting [Third Strike: Online Edition](http://www.destructoid.com/preview-street-fighter-iii-3rd-strike-online-edition-208072.phtml) when it's released next week. To cap a good evening off, I managed to get the producer of the Street Fighter IV series, [Yoshinori Ono](https://twitter.com/#!/Yoshi_OnoChin "Yoshinori Ono on Twitter"), to [sign my joystick](http://www.flickr.com/photos/coderkind/6063172383/in/photostream).
