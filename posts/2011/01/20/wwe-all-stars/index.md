I'm hoping [WWE All Stars](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/gamesblog/2011/jan/19/wwe-all-stars-hands-on) is a return to old school wrestling games such as the excellent (back-in-the-day) Wrestlefest arcade machine, which my brother and I spent countless hours and coins on. The preview from The Guardian seems to suggest it is a return, so I'm hopeful.
