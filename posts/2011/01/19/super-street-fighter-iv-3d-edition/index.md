Capcom have revealed more footage of the upcoming Super Street Fighter IV: 3D Edition for the Nintendo 3DS. This demo from Capcom's Seth Killian is great as it seems to suggest new people to the franchise along with pros will be able to get something from the game.

While I'm not that happy with the pricing for the new console, if I spot a retailer selling it along with the new Street Fighter for around Â£220 I know I'll find it difficult to resist. Damn.
