I couldn't help myself. I've joined the iPad 2 club and I have to say I'm enjoying it a lot so far.

I was sceptable for ages but then a couple of weeks ago I decided to visit an Apple Store and try one out and I was impressed with how browsing the web on touchscreen seemed to somehow bring the experience closer to me. I know that sounds corny (like some of the promotional advertisements) but it's true. Last night was spent using the device to read some PDF's in bed whilest listening to some classical music and I found the experience really enjoyable (so much so that I'm [planning on boosting my classical collection](http://www.classicalcdguide.com/) now).

I've still got to pick a case for it (the smart covers don't cover the back of the device so I've ruled them out) and I felt a little self-conscious using it on the tube, but otherwise I've few complaints.
