As Flash seemingly continues to suffer in terms of... well, everything I guess, a recent trip highlighted once again the widespread problems that remain on a number of sites when it comes to Flash detection.

I was asked Flash-detect questions on a few occasions by family and friends relating to either Flash being downloadable on tablets (which is now largely impossible) or whether the quick flash of "you don't have Flash" text that sometimes appears on computers before a detection script kicks-in and displays Adobe Flash content was something they needed to be worried about. The latter case was a particularly bad example of where Flash was used to display seating arrangements in the middle of an online booking process and therefore the person making the booking wasn't sure what the "you don't have Flash" text was initially, or if it was something they needed to be concerned about before entering their credit card details.

I'd like to see more sites audit their detection scripts to take into account where the Flash plug-in is in mid-2013. Offering a download option where there is none is a horrible dead-end for those without experience of Flash and its history across devices.
