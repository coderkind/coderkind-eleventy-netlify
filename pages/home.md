# Welcome

This is the home of the mothballed coderkind.com website/blog. I say "mothballed"; I do not intend to publish ongoing posts, but decided to migrate it from Wordpress to 11ty as a learning exercise (and to avoid having to pay hosting fees for something I wasn't persisting with). I might spruce it up somewhat in the coming weeks and months; kinda like taking fresh flowers to a graveside.

Or I might start posting again.

This is a template for building a simple blog website with the [Eleventy static site generator](https://www.11ty.io), with deployment to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).

Includes [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org) for WYSIWYG content editing, and [Netlify Forms](https://www.netlify.com/docs/form-handling) for processing your site's form data.

For more info on installation and usage, view the [project repo]({{ pkg.repository.url }}) on GitHub.

Or click the button below to deploy your own copy of this project to Netlify.
